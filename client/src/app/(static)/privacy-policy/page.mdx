You can exercise the rights described above when we receive a verified request in accordance with applicable law.

### Communication and Marketing Preferences

- Email and Text Messages. If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, please access the “Notification settings” option for the relevant profile within the “Account” of our website. Alternatively, click the “unsubscribe” link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message (note: you may receive a confirmation text message in this case). Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from transactional messages from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.

- Push Notifications. You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Movflx. Movflx will send you push notifications from time to time in accordance with any notification preferences you have set on your mobile device. If you later decide you no longer want to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device’s settings to turn them off (or via the “Notification settings” described in the preceding ). Please note that individual Movflx games may have their own push notifications (you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off). We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers.

- Matched Identifier Communications from Movflx. Some third party services allow us to reach users with online marketing about Movflx content or the Movflx service by sending privacy protected contact information to the third party. Privacy protected contact information means we use deidentification technologies to convert the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares Movflx’s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with Movflx and the third party. If there is a match, Movflx can then choose whether or not to send Movflx marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” of our website.

- Marketing of the Movflx service using cookies and similar technologies. To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs collected for marketing of the Movflx service or Movflx content on third party service, please use the tools described in the “Cookies and Internet Advertising” below.

## <ins> C: Access to Account and Profiles </ins>

- Sharing your account with others: As a Movflx member, if you share your account with others in your household, please ensure that they are aware of and have read this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement applies to their use of Movflx (except s that only apply to the member, such as those related to payments). Please note that the member controls the Movflx account and all profiles, the information in the account and all profiles, and whether to share (or stop sharing) the account with individuals in their household.

- If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they may be able to see viewing information, account information in the “Account” of the service, and game related information such as chat contents and saved game information. This remains true even when you use the profiles feature, although you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile (see help.Movflx.com/node/114277). Please note that viewing history, recommendations, “continue watching” and similar information may be made available through various features and user experiences, such as Partner interfaces that are integrated with the Movflx service.

- Profiles: Profiles allow users on a Movflx account to have a personalized Movflx experience, built around the Movflx content of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Movflx account, so that anyone with access to your Movflx account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles, and information within or associated with the profile (although, as noted above, you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile). You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not want them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number, or other information to the profile and will be provided with a notice at the time such information is provided (the “Profile Privacy Notice” applies – see help.Movflx.com/legal/profileprivacy). We also have various parental controls available and you can learn more here: help.Movflx.com/node/264.

- Profile Transfers: The profile transfer feature on your account allows you and users with access to your account to transfer an eligible profile from your account to a separate account (including information such as viewing history and recommendations). You can change the setting for this feature in the “Account” of our website. You can learn more here: help.Movflx.com/node/122698.

- Account Login Features: You may have the option to use certain account login features, such as email-based or text message-based login, or easier login to the Movflx app on certain devices. Please note that any device that is logged into your account will remain logged in unless you log out of those devices (following the instructions in the below).

- Removing device access to your Movflx account: To remove access to your Movflx account from devices that are logged into the account, visit the “Account” of our website, locate the “Sign out of all devices” option, and follow the instructions to sign out of your devices. Users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each session. If you sell or return a computer or Movflx ready device, be sure to first log out. If you or other users on the account do not maintain the security of your email address, password, and signed-in devices, or fail to log out a device you sell or return, then subsequent users on that device will likely be able to access your Movflx account, including your personal information.

## <ins> D: Cookies and Internet Advertising </ins>

### Use of Cookies

We, our Service Providers, Movflx Marketing Providers, and Advertising Companies use cookies, other similar technologies (such as pixel tags), and resettable device identifiers for various reasons. This explains the types of technologies used, what they do, and your corresponding choices. To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the below “How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?”

### Cookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, and Resettable Device Identifiers

Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server.

We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.

If you use a Movflx app (such as the main Movflx app, or a Movflx game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant, and for analytics and optimization purposes

### Why Does Movflx Use These Technologies?

We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use. These technologies enable Movflx Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Movflx Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.

We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our services. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened.

Movflx uses resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Movflx content on third party services, and to operate our ad supported subscription plan (including delivering Advertisements to you).
